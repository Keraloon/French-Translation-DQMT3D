French Translation Files for Dragon Quest Monsters : Terry's Wonderland 3D 

Update : the path has been corrected to data/Event instead of Demo and Field, Some Monsters and texts was not correctly translated and exceeded the textbox

All Monsters, Abilities, Dialogues, Location etc.. has been translated 
All Wi-Fi and Streetpass texts has been kept in English (and location on the mini map too)

This is not a patch in xDelta for now. 

If you find problems within the texts, let me know.


!! In order to install the patch you need to put the data folder in "0004000000074600\romfs" folder on Citra\load\mods for Citra, and luma\titles for 3ds with luma !!
